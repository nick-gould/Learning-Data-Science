## Resources for Learning Data Science, Statistics, Machine Learning, and \<insert buzz word here>

### Why does this document exist?

I've had many friends, coworkers, acquaintances, and random denizens of various social media communities express interest in learning more about how to either become a data scientist or learn data science related skills they could apply to whatever projects they're working on. I created this document to throw a much of the ideas in one place and am sharing it on [Github](https://github.com/nick-gould) for anyone to access.
